This is a Power BI dashboard visualising revenue data Between October 2020 and September 2021 using a large dataset with more than 200,000 observations. 

These graphs help determine the areas that had the highest performance based on date, location and customer demographics. It also illustrates whether there is a relationship between sales and discounts. 

The dashboard is available as a fully interactive Power BI .pbix file. I also included a .pdf version for easier access, however it is not interactive and you won't bee able to use filters or drill-downs.
